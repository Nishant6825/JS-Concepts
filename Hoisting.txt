JAVASCRIPT HOISTING – INTERVIEW NOTES

What is Hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase of execution context.

Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

Why Hoisting Happens?
Hoisting happens because JavaScript executes code in two phases:

Memory Creation Phase

Code Execution Phase

During memory creation, variables and functions are allocated memory.

Hoisting with var

var declarations are hoisted

Initialized with undefined

Example:
console.log(a);
var a = 10;

Memory Phase:
a -> undefined

Output:
undefined

Hoisting with let and const

let and const are hoisted

BUT they are not initialized

They stay in Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

Example:
console.log(b);
let b = 10;

Output:
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

TDZ is the time between:

Variable hoisting

Variable initialization

Accessing let or const variables in TDZ throws ReferenceError.

Hoisting with const

const must be initialized at declaration

Hoisted but not accessible before initialization

Example:
const x = 5; (valid)
const y; (invalid)

Function Hoisting

Function declarations are fully hoisted.

Example:
greet();

function greet() {
console.log("Hello");
}

Output:
Hello

Function Expression Hoisting

Function expressions depend on variable hoisting.

Example:
sayHi();

var sayHi = function() {
console.log("Hi");
};

Output:
TypeError: sayHi is not a function

Reason:
sayHi is hoisted as undefined

Arrow Function Hoisting

Arrow functions behave like function expressions.

Example:
hello();

const hello = () => {
console.log("Hello");
};

Output:
ReferenceError (TDZ)

Hoisting Summary Table

var:

Hoisted

Initialized as undefined

Accessible before declaration

let:

Hoisted

Not initialized

In TDZ

const:

Hoisted

Not initialized

In TDZ

Function Declaration:

Fully hoisted

Can be called before definition

Function Expression / Arrow Function:

Hoisted depending on variable

Cannot be called before assignment

Common Interview Questions

Q: Is JavaScript hoisted?
A: Yes, declarations are hoisted during memory creation phase.

Q: Are let and const hoisted?
A: Yes, but they remain in Temporal Dead Zone.

Q: What is TDZ?
A: The period between variable hoisting and initialization where access is not allowed.

Q: Why var returns undefined but let throws error?
A: var is initialized with undefined, let is not initialized.

One-Line Interview Answer

Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope during the memory creation phase, allowing var and function declarations to be accessed before their actual definition.
