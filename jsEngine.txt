JAVASCRIPT ENGINE – INTERVIEW NOTES

What is a JavaScript Engine?
A JavaScript Engine is a program that executes JavaScript code.

It converts JavaScript code into machine code that the computer can understand.

Examples of JavaScript Engines

V8 → Google Chrome, Node.js

SpiderMonkey → Firefox

JavaScriptCore → Safari

Chakra → Older Microsoft Edge

Is JavaScript Interpreted or Compiled?
JavaScript is both interpreted and compiled.

Modern JS engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
for better performance.

Main Components of a JavaScript Engine

Memory Heap

Call Stack

Memory Heap

Used for memory allocation

Stores objects, arrays, functions

Managed automatically by Garbage Collector

Call Stack

Executes code line by line

Uses LIFO (Last In, First Out)

Stores execution contexts

How JavaScript Engine Works (High Level Flow)

JavaScript code is parsed

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is created

Code is compiled using JIT

Code is executed

Garbage collector frees unused memory

Parsing Phase

JS engine reads the code

Checks for syntax errors

Converts code into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

Compilation (JIT – Just In Time)

Code is compiled at runtime

Optimized for performance

Frequently used code is optimized further

Execution Phase

Execution contexts are created

Code runs inside Call Stack

Variables and functions are handled

Garbage Collection

Automatically removes unused memory

Prevents memory leaks

Uses algorithms like Mark and Sweep

JavaScript Engine vs JavaScript Runtime

JavaScript Engine:

Executes JavaScript code

Example: V8

JavaScript Runtime:

Engine + Web APIs + Event Loop + Callback Queue

Example: Browser, Node.js

Important Interview Clarification

JavaScript Engine does NOT handle:

setTimeout

DOM

fetch

Promises resolution

These are handled by the JavaScript Runtime environment.

One-Line Interview Answer

A JavaScript engine is a program that parses, compiles, and executes JavaScript code using components like the call stack and memory heap.

Common Interview Questions

Q: What is V8?
A: V8 is Google’s high-performance JavaScript engine written in C++.

Q: What is JIT compilation?
A: Just-In-Time compilation converts JavaScript code to optimized machine code at runtime.

Q: Does JS engine manage memory?
A: Yes, using automatic garbage collection.
