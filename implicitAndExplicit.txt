JAVASCRIPT IMPLICIT & EXPLICIT TYPE CONVERSION

What is Type Conversion?
Type conversion means changing one data type into another.

JavaScript performs type conversion in two ways:

Implicit Conversion (Type Coercion)

Explicit Conversion (Manual Conversion)

Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion)

Implicit conversion happens automatically by JavaScript
when an operation involves different data types.

Implicit Conversion Examples

Number + String:
"5" + 2 = "52"
Explanation:
Number is converted to string

String - Number:
"5" - 2 = 3
Explanation:
String is converted to number

String * Number:
"5" * 2 = 10

String / Number:
"10" / 2 = 5

Boolean Conversion (Implicit)

true + 1 = 2
false + 1 = 1

Explanation:
true becomes 1
false becomes 0

Null Conversion

null + 1 = 1
Explanation:
null becomes 0

Undefined Conversion

undefined + 1 = NaN
Explanation:
undefined cannot be converted to a number

Implicit Conversion with Equality (==)

== allows type coercion

Examples:
"5" == 5 -> true
true == 1 -> true
null == undefined -> true

Strict Equality (===)

=== does NOT allow type coercion

Examples:
"5" === 5 -> false
true === 1 -> false

Explicit Type Conversion

Explicit conversion is done manually by the developer.

Explicit Conversion to Number

Number("10") -> 10
Number("10a") -> NaN

parseInt("10") -> 10
parseFloat("10.5") -> 10.5

Explicit Conversion to String

String(10) -> "10"
(10).toString() -> "10"

Explicit Conversion to Boolean

Boolean(1) -> true
Boolean(0) -> false
Boolean("") -> false
Boolean("hello") -> true

Common Interview Traps

"5" + 5 = "55"
"5" - 5 = 0

[] + [] = ""
[] + {} = "[object Object]"
{} + [] = 0 (in non-strict context)

When to Use What?

Use Implicit Conversion:

Avoid in critical logic

Can cause bugs if not understood

Use Explicit Conversion:

Preferred in production code

Improves readability and safety

Interview Questions

Q: What is implicit type conversion?
A: Automatic conversion performed by JavaScript during operations.

Q: What is explicit type conversion?
A: Manual conversion done by the developer using built-in functions.

Q: Difference between == and ===?
A:
== compares values after type conversion
=== compares both value and type

One-Line Interview Answer

Implicit conversion is automatically done by JavaScript during operations, while explicit conversion is manually performed by developers using conversion methods.
