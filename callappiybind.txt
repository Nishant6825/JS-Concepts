CALL, APPLY & BIND – INTERVIEW NOTES

What are call, apply and bind?
call, apply and bind are methods used to control the value of this in JavaScript.

They allow a function to be executed with a specific this context.

Why do we need call, apply, bind?

In JavaScript:

this depends on how a function is called

Sometimes we want to manually set this

call, apply and bind solve this problem.

call()

call() invokes a function immediately
and accepts arguments one by one.

Syntax:
functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)

call() Example

let user = {
name: "Nishant"
};

function greet(age, city) {
console.log(this.name, age, city);
}

greet.call(user, 25, "Pune");

Output:
Nishant 25 Pune

apply()

apply() invokes a function immediately
and accepts arguments as an array.

Syntax:
functionName.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])

apply() Example

greet.apply(user, [25, "Pune"]);

Output:
Nishant 25 Pune

bind()

bind() does NOT invoke the function immediately.
It returns a new function with bound this.

Syntax:
let newFn = functionName.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)

bind() Example

let boundGreet = greet.bind(user, 25, "Pune");
boundGreet();

Output:
Nishant 25 Pune

call vs apply vs bind (Key Differences)

call:

Invokes immediately

Arguments passed individually

apply:

Invokes immediately

Arguments passed as array

bind:

Does NOT invoke immediately

Returns a new function

When to Use What?

Use call:

When arguments are known individually

Immediate function execution

Use apply:

When arguments are already in an array

Math.max, Math.min use cases

Use bind:

When function needs to be called later

Event handlers

setTimeout, callbacks

Real Interview Example (Very Important)

Borrowing a method:

let user1 = {
name: "A"
};

let user2 = {
name: "B"
};

function show() {
console.log(this.name);
}

show.call(user1); // A
show.call(user2); // B

call/apply with Math.max

let nums = [1, 5, 9, 3];

Math.max.apply(null, nums); // 9

(call also works with spread)

bind with setTimeout (Common Interview Question)

let user = {
name: "Nishant",
greet: function() {
console.log(this.name);
}
};

setTimeout(user.greet, 1000);
// Output: undefined (this lost)

Fix using bind:
setTimeout(user.greet.bind(user), 1000);
// Output: Nishant

Important Interview Points

call and apply execute immediately

bind returns a new function

bind does not change original function

bind is commonly used in callbacks

Common Interview Questions

Q: Does bind execute the function?
A: No, it returns a new function.

Q: Difference between call and apply?
A: call takes arguments individually, apply takes arguments as an array.

Q: Can we change this of arrow function using call/apply/bind?
A: No, arrow functions do not have their own this.

One-Line Interview Answer

call and apply invoke a function immediately with a specified this, while bind returns a new function with permanently bound this for later execution.
