1. What is this?

this refers to the object that is executing the current function.
Its value is decided at runtime, not at function creation time.

Rule:

this depends on HOW a function is called

2. this in Global Scope

Browser:

this === window


Node.js:

this === {}

3. this inside Normal Function
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
show();


Non-strict mode:

window


Strict mode:

undefined

4. this inside Object Method
const user = {
  name: "Nishant",
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

user.greet();


Output:

Nishant


this refers to the object before the dot.

5. Losing this inside Nested Function
const user = {
  name: "Nishant",
  greet() {
    function inner() {
      console.log(this.name);
    }
    inner();
  }
};


Output:

undefined


Reason:
Inner function is a normal function.

6. Arrow Function Fix
const user = {
  name: "Nishant",
  greet() {
    const inner = () => {
      console.log(this.name);
    };
    inner();
  }
};


Arrow functions inherit this from parent scope.

7. this in Arrow Functions

Arrow functions:

Do NOT have their own this

Take this from lexical scope

const obj = {
  a: 10,
  arrow: () => {
    console.log(this.a);
  }
};


Output:

undefined

8. Correct Use of Arrow Function
const obj = {
  a: 10,
  method() {
    const arrow = () => {
      console.log(this.a);
    };
    arrow();
  }
};


Output:

10

9. this with call, apply, bind

call:

fn.call(obj, arg1, arg2)


apply:

fn.apply(obj, [arg1, arg2])


bind:

const newFn = fn.bind(obj)


bind returns a new function.

10. this in Constructor Function
function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const u1 = new User("Nishant");


this refers to the newly created object.

11. this in Class
class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}


Same behavior as constructor functions.

12. this in Event Listeners

Normal function:

button.onclick = function () {
  console.log(this);
};


this → HTML element

Arrow function:

button.onclick = () => {
  console.log(this);
};


this → window

13. this in setTimeout

Problem:

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(this);
}, 1000);


Fix:

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(this);
}, 1000);

14. this Precedence Order

new

bind

call / apply

Object method

Default (window / undefined)

15. Tricky Example
const obj = {
  name: "A",
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

const fn = obj.getName;
fn();


Output:

undefined


Fix:

const fn = obj.getName.bind(obj);

16. Interview One-Liners

this depends on function call

Arrow functions don’t have this

bind permanently fixes this

call/apply invoke immediately

Strict mode changes default this

17. MOST ASKED QUESTION

Why arrow functions should not be used as methods?

Answer:
Arrow functions do not have their own this, so they cannot refer to the calling object.

18. FINAL INTERVIEW STATEMENT

JavaScript determines this at runtime based on how a function is invoked.
Arrow functions inherit this from lexical scope, while normal functions get this dynamically.
