JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES – INTERVIEW REVISION NOTES

What are Data Types?
Data types specify what type of value a variable can store.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are decided at runtime.

Number of Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript has 8 data types:
7 Primitive
1 Non-Primitive (Object)

Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types store values directly and are immutable.

Number
Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
Includes special values like Infinity and NaN.

Example:
let x = 10;
let y = 10.5;

Important points:

JavaScript has no separate int or float type

typeof NaN returns "number"

String
Represents textual data.
Can be written using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.

Example:
let name = "Nishant";

Important points:

Strings are immutable

Template literals use backticks

Boolean
Represents logical values: true or false.

Example:
let isValid = true;

Falsy values in JavaScript:
false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN

Undefined
A variable that is declared but not assigned any value.

Example:
let a;

Important point:

Default value assigned by JavaScript

Null
Represents intentional absence of value.
Assigned manually by the developer.

Example:
let data = null;

Important point:

typeof null returns "object" (this is a JavaScript bug)

Symbol (ES6)
Used to create unique identifiers.
Mainly used as object keys to avoid conflicts.

Example:
let id = Symbol("id");

Important point:

Each Symbol is unique

BigInt
Used to represent very large integers.
Ends with the letter n.

Example:
let big = 12345678901234567890n;

Important points:

Cannot mix BigInt with Number

Used when Number exceeds safe integer limit

Non-Primitive Data Type

Object
Stores data in key-value pairs.
Stored by reference.

Example:
let user = { name: "Nishant", age: 25 };

Array (Special Object)
Used to store multiple values.

Example:
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

Important point:

typeof array returns "object"

Array.isArray() is used to check arrays

Function (Special Object)
Functions are callable objects.

Example:
function greet() {}

Important point:

typeof function returns "function"

Primitive vs Reference Types

Primitive:

Stored by value

Immutable

Compared by value

Reference:

Stored by reference

Mutable

Compared by memory reference

Example:
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
Result: a remains 10

Example:
let obj1 = { x: 1 };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.x = 5;
Result: obj1.x becomes 5

typeof Operator Results

typeof 10 -> number
typeof "hello" -> string
typeof true -> boolean
typeof undefined -> undefined
typeof null -> object (bug)
typeof {} -> object
typeof [] -> object
typeof function(){} -> function

Common Interview Questions

Q: Is JavaScript statically typed?
A: No, JavaScript is dynamically typed.

Q: Why does typeof null return object?
A: It is a known bug in JavaScript, kept for backward compatibility.

Q: Difference between null and undefined?
null:

Intentional absence of value

Assigned by developer

undefined:

Variable declared but not assigned

Assigned by JavaScript

Q: Is array a primitive data type?
A: No, array is an object.

One-Line Interview Answer

JavaScript has 8 data types where primitive types are stored by value and non-primitive types are stored by reference, making JavaScript a dynamically typed language.
